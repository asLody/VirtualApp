Project Profile
---------------

VirtualApp is a commercial project developed and operated by Luohe technology, which creates a virtual space within your App. You can `install, start and uninstall APK arbitrarily in the virtual space`, which is isolated from the outside, like a *sandbox*. 
APK running in VA does not need to be `installed externally`, that is, the VA supports running APK without installation.
VA is currently widely used in plug-in development, non-thermal update, cloud control automation, multi-open, mobile game rent number, mobile game handle activation free, block chain, mobile office security, military and government secrecy, mobile phone simulation information, script automation, automated testing and other technical fields, but it is not limited to this. Android itself is an extremely open platform, `and the ability to run APK without installing it opens up unlimited possibilities -- which depend on your imagination.`
The code on Github has been updated since December 2017. The commercial version of the code is still being updated, with the following improvements:

1. New Code Characteristics
2. Framework optimization and performance improvement
3. Compatibility of mobile phone system and APP has been greatly improved
4. Run Google services perfectly
5. Compatibility with the latest Android Q (10.0)
6. Support running 64-bit App
7. Java Hook that supports Dalvik and Art (API and Xposed)
8. Add positioning simulation code
9. Add the machine changing code
10. Please refer to the table below for details of the repair and improvement of more than 180 other problems
