But as time goes on,
the compatibility of it is getting better and better.

so you must use our `android.jar` replace the old one **(Android-SDK/platforms/android-23/{android.jar})**. 

2. Add **all permissions** your host and your plugins need to use.

3. Goto your Application and insert the following code:
```java
    @Override
    protected void attachBaseContext(Context base) {
        super.attachBaseContext(base);
        try {
            VirtualCore.getCore().startup(base);
        } catch (Throwable e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
```

4. For **Install a virtual App**, use this function:
```java
    VirtualCore.getCore().installApp({APK PATH}, flags);
    
```

5. For **Launch a virtual App**, use this function:
```java
    VirtualCore.getCore().launchApp({PackageName});
```

6. For **uninstall a virtual App**, use this function:
```java
